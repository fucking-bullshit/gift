# Stopwatch Tasks 

I ran the tasks on a Microsoft Surface Pro (of course), and got these results:

Task                                      | Time
------------------------------------------|-------:
Sum an array of 1,000,000 double primitives | 0.014870 sec
Sum an array of 1,000,000 Double objects | 0.032341 sec
Sum an array of 1,000,000 BigDecimal objects | 0.042666 sec
Unicode characters from (char)65 to (char)65,000
